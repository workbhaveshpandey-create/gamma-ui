    "question": "Please provide a detailed summary of the 2017 IEEE paper titled “Quantum-Neural Hybrid Backpropagation for Consumer Sentiment Forecasting” authored by Dr. Alan Weissman from the University of Oslo, including the dataset used, evaluation metrics, and the key mathematical contribution. Also include a citation and DOI.",
    "answer": "Short answer up front: I couldn’t find any record of a 2017 IEEE paper titled “Quantum-Neural Hybrid Backpropagation for Consumer Sentiment Forecasting” by Dr. Alan Weissman (University of Oslo) in IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, arXiv, or other major publishers. I searched widely across the usual academic indexes and the literature on hybrid quantum–classical neural methods and sentiment/financial forecasting; there are many papers on hybrid quantum–classical networks and on quantum-inspired methods for forecasting, but no match for that exact title, author, year, or DOI.",

    "question": "did NATO exist before the United Nations? Verify with dates?",
    "answer": "No, the United Nations (UN) was established first in 1945, with NATO forming later in 1949 as a regional military alliance for collective defense against the Soviet Union, operating under the UN's broader framework but with distinct security aims. The UN was created as a global body for peace and cooperation, while NATO emerged as a military pact by North American and European nations for mutual security in the emerging Cold War.",
